# Changelog

Each entry says what was not done or not verified. Per-crate changelogs hold the detail.

## 2026-10-21 - Audit-head checkpoint

- `GET /api/audit/verify` returns `head` (id and digest of the newest row checked) and accepts
  `?checkpoint_id=&checkpoint_digest=` from an earlier answer. A checkpoint row that is missing (newer rows removed, or a
  checkpoint from another database) or has a different digest gives 409 at that id; one parameter without the other is
  400. `audit::verify_against` does the work; `verify` and `verify_in_batches` are unchanged. 1 new Postgres test
  (10 in `tests/audit_chain.rs`), including batch sizes 1, 2 and 100. Idea 1 of
  `spec/interoperability/openehr-comparison.md`.
- **Not done:** nothing publishes the head. Removal of the newest rows is detected only if an operator stored a head
  where the database owner cannot write; without one the answer still says so. Not run by hand against Keycloak; the
  query-string handler is not covered by an automated test (the logic is).

## 2026-10-21 - Documented minimum Rust is 1.97

- `rust-version` is now 1.97 in the service, migration and matcher `Cargo.toml`, and in `AGENTS.md` and `plan.md`: the
  current release (1.99) minus two. The pinned toolchain is unchanged (1.99.1).
- **Not done:** CI has no job that builds with exactly 1.97, so the minimum is declared, not tested. The matcher on
  crates.io still says 1.96 until it is republished.

## 2026-10-21 - Patient-visible access log (SE-6, partly)

- `GET /api/me/patients/{id}/access-log`: who accessed this record, newest first, 50 per page. Only the patient or a
  proxy (an active `self` or `proxy` relationship) may read it, at purpose `patient-access`; a clinician's treating
  relationship does not. Entries say `you` or `staff`, what was done, to what, the purpose and whether it was refused or
  a break-glass opening; they carry no staff identifier, `detail` or network address. A new migration adds the index
  `audit_events_patient_log_idx`. `/my-record` shows it on request. 1 Postgres test, 2 service unit tests, 5 vitest, 1
  stubbed browser test and 1 real-Keycloak browser test (the clinician's view appears to the patient); also by hand
  against Keycloak: 401 with no token, 403 and an audit row for a clinician.
- **Not done:** role and organisation are not shown, because audit rows record only the token `sub` (threading roles
  into the ~17 audit call sites, and a deployment policy for staff names, are separate work). No filter or date range,
  no export, no alert. The handler itself has no automated test without a Keycloak stack; the "patient but not linked"
  branch is covered by the policy engine refusing earlier. The new Keycloak test needs a fresh database or new data: the
  older ones re-run only on one.

## 2026-10-21 - Roles and organisations in audit rows and the patient's log

- Every audit row written while handling a request records the caller's roles and organisations in `detail.actor`
  (`audit::ACTOR`, a task-local set by the route-gate middleware, so the ~17 call sites did not change). `Subject` gained
  `organisations`, from the token attribute `organisation` (short lowercase tokens only). The patient's access log shows
  "A member of staff (clinician, riverside) viewed your identity record." Development: realm role `org-riverside`, mapped
  in `role-map.json`; `keycloak-dev-user.sh` takes comma-separated roles. Tests: 2 audit and 1 policy unit tests, 1
  `authz_audit` and the extended `patient_log` Postgres tests, 1 vitest, stubbed and real-Keycloak browser tests updated;
  by hand the row for a clinician with `org-riverside` read `{"roles":["clinician"],"organisations":["riverside"]}`.
- **Not done:** rows written before this change have no actor and read "staff". Rows written outside a request (tests,
  future jobs) have none. Roles are recorded as the token said at that moment, not checked against a directory. Staff
  names are still not recorded or shown. The hash chain covers `actor` (it is in `detail`); no chain format change.

## 2026-10-21 - FHIR Patient endpoint (ID-3, in part)

- `GET/POST /fhir/R4/Patient`, `GET/PUT /fhir/R4/Patient/{id}` and `GET /fhir/R4/metadata`, over the existing
  `interop::fhir_patient` mapping. The controller only translates: it calls the `/api/patients` handlers, so access
  control, consent and the audit row are the same code. `Stored` is now `Deserialize`. 7 unit tests; run by hand and in the
  real-Keycloak suite (create 201 with `ETag` and `Location`, read, search Bundle, duplicate 409 without candidates,
  `maritalStatus` 422, no `If-Match` 428, stale 412, exact-date-only search 400). The route table and census know the five
  routes.
- **Not done:** FHIR `_history`, `vread`, delete, conditional create/update, `_include`, paging, `_count`, `_sort` and
  date prefixes; Patient elements beyond identity (those are refused, not stored); no US Core or UK Core profile claim and
  no conformance run (e.g. Inspector or a validator); `metadata` needs a token (it is not public). No handler-level
  automated test in `cargo test` (no `AppContext` harness): the translation is unit tested and the whole path is run
  against Keycloak by hand and in the opt-in browser suite.

## 2026-10-21 - An unheld key is a key problem, not tampering

- `Chain::check` tells "the digest is wrong" (`Mismatch`) from "this process cannot check it" (`KeyNotHeld`,
  `SchemeUnknown`). `GET /api/audit/verify` answers **424** with `tampering_found:false`, the unchecked count, the first
  unchecked row and the causes, instead of 409 naming a row as broken. The scan continues past such rows, so a real break
  further down still gives 409. Idea 2 of `spec/interoperability/openehr-comparison.md`. Tests: 2 unit, 1 Postgres
  (rotation without keeping the old key, the endpoint answer, the held-but-wrong key, a break behind unchecked rows).
- **Not done:** an unkeyed `sha256:` row in a keyed chain is still 409, so enabling a key on an existing chain makes the old
  rows read as broken; the openEHR "unkeyed only" state is not modelled. Not run by hand against Keycloak or a rotated
  key in the real service. A monitor that treats every non-200 the same will not notice the difference.

## 2026-10-21 - Clinical hazard log (AS-1, partly)

- `governance/clinical-safety/hazard-log.csv`: 15 hazards for what the code does today (wrong-patient link, missed
  duplicate, NHS number, lost update, unentitled access, ignored consent, unmasked sensitive data, no emergency access,
  audit tamper and gaps, wrong relationship, bad ingestion, misleading access log, unreviewed translations, use before
  ready), each with cause, effect, 1-5 ratings, controls, evidence paths and residual risk. Plus an unsigned risk
  management plan and safety case report template. `scripts/check-hazard-log.py` (shape, score arithmetic, evidence
  paths exist, no `accepted`/`closed` without a named reviewer; 9 unit tests) runs in the docs job;
  `scripts/check-clinical-impact.sh` and a `hazard-log` job fail a `clinical-impact` PR that leaves the log alone.
- **Not done:** the ratings are the author's proposals and were reviewed by nobody; there is no named Clinical Safety
  Officer (OQ-2) and no safety case report; this is not DCB0129 compliance. The workflow job has not run on GitHub (no
  remote) and the label has to be applied by a person. Seven hazards are `open` with no adequate control (e.g. H-008,
  no emergency access).

## 2026-10-21 - Audit read API (AU-2)

- `GET /api/audit` and `GET /fhir/R4/AuditEvent`: search the audit trail, auditor role only, newest first, 50 per page.
  `audit::search` builds one parameterised query (no string-built SQL; dates are checked by the database before use, so a
  bad date is 400, not 500). A search writes its own audit row with the names of the criteria, not their values. New
  `interop::fhir_audit` (typed R4 `AuditEvent`, validated). The route table and census know the two routes.
  Tests: 1 Postgres (every filter, paging, blank criteria, injection-shaped input), 3 + 1 unit, and by hand and in the
  real-Keycloak suite (no token 401, clinician 403 with the refusal visible to the auditor, auditor 200).
- **Not done:** `le`/`gt` date prefixes (the store compares whole instants), full-text search of `detail`, export, an
  AuditEvent `read` by id, the digests in the output, any IHE BALP conformance claim (purpose-of-use codes are local),
  and a patient-facing use of this search (the patient log, SE-6, has its own narrower endpoint). The gate's 403 is a plain
  `forbidden`, not an `OperationOutcome`, on the FHIR routes.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-20

Milestone M0, scaffold. **Not for clinical use.**

### Added

- **Matcher** (`electronic-patient-record-matcher-with-rust`): `Patient` identity type; deterministic, symmetric,
  explainable matching with per-field breakdown; NHS number modulus-11 validation; refusals for twins, missing
  given names, differing verified NHS numbers; 13 tests.
- **Service** (`electronic-patient-record-service-with-rust`): loco.rs app; PASETO bearer guard, on by default,
  refusing to start without keys or with login off in production; `POST /api/patients/compare`; append-only
  `audit_events` table with triggers; 6 unit tests and 2 database-gated tests.
- **UI** (`electronic-patient-record-ui-with-svelte`): SvelteKit shell, locale-prefixed URLs, strict CSP and
  security headers, proxy that only forwards `/api`, a compare page; 26 unit tests, 7 browser tests with axe.
- CI, release workflow, root `compose.yaml`, Containerfiles, scripts.

### Added after the first cut: audit writer (AU-1, partly)

- `audit::append` / `audit::verify`: hash-chained, keyed with `EPR_INTEGRITY_MAC_KEY` when set. `compare` now writes an
  audit row before answering and returns 500, with no result, if it cannot. 6 unit and 7 Postgres tests.
- Found and fixed while testing by hand: my first key variable name was wrong (`EPR_INTEGRITY_KEY`; the crate derives
  `EPR_INTEGRITY_MAC_KEY`), so the chain silently stayed unkeyed. A unit test now pins the names.

### Added after the first cut: Keycloak (SE-8)

- The guard accepts Keycloak access tokens; `v4.` tokens still go to PASETO, everything else to Keycloak. The audit agent is the
  token `sub`. Invalid Keycloak configuration refuses to start. 8 DB-free tests plus a by-hand run against Keycloak 26.3.0.
- `keycloak` compose profile (Keycloak on the shared PostgreSQL, realm `epr` imported), `scripts/keycloak-dev-user.sh`,
  `scripts/keycloak-dev-token.sh`, and standalone `scripts/podman-postgres.sh` / `scripts/podman-redis.sh` (both tried).
- **Not done:** roles are not consulted; the UI cannot sign in (SE-9); the API cannot reach a plain-HTTP Keycloak from inside compose
  (it needs HTTPS); the CI container job does not exercise Keycloak; tested only on one node, `start-dev`.

### Added after the first cut: UI sign-in (SE-9)

- The UI signs readers in through Keycloak (`epr-web`, authorization code flow with PKCE) in its backend-for-frontend. The browser holds one
  opaque `httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` session cookie (`__Host-` prefixed over HTTPS); the tokens stay in the server's session store, which
  sends the access token to the API, refreshes it before it expires, ends idle (15 min) and over-long (8 h) sessions, and signs out
  locally first and then at Keycloak. Cross-site POSTs to the proxy and to sign-out are refused. Off unless `EPR_OIDC_ISSUER` is set;
  a bad value stops the UI at startup. 24 new unit tests (50 in all).
- Verified by hand on 2026-10-21 against Keycloak 26.3.0 and the real API (`playwright.keycloak.config.ts`, 5 passed, 1 skipped): sign-in, a
  protected call that returned 200 with the audit row's agent set to the Keycloak `sub`, sign-out, a tampered cookie, a replayed
  pre-sign-out cookie, a forged callback, and cross-site POSTs.
- **Not done:** the session store is in process memory, so a restart signs everyone out and two UI replicas cannot share sessions; token
  refresh and idle expiry are tested with a stub provider only (Keycloak's access token lives 300 s and the run did not wait); the
  ID token is decoded, not signature-checked (allowed for a token straight from the token endpoint, OIDC Core 3.1.3.7; the API checks
  the access token on every call); no front-channel or back-channel logout from Keycloak into the UI; the Keycloak end-to-end run is
  not in CI; no Entra ID; the sign-in and sign-out text is English only.

### Added after the first cut: policy engine and route gate (SE-1, in part)

- `policy.rs`: ten roles, nine resource kinds, six actions (no delete), care relationship, security labels, purpose of use, consent and
  break-the-glass, as a pure engine. `authz.rs` gates every route on the token's `role` attribute; a route with no entry in
  `routes.rs` is 403 for everyone; each refusal is audited (route template, method and roles, never the body). `tests/route_census.rs`
  fails when the served routes and the table disagree (checked by emptying the table). Keycloak realm roles map to policy roles through
  `operations/keycloak/role-map.json`; `scripts/keycloak-dev-user.sh` takes a role.
- Tested: 15 engine tests including a 907,200-request matrix checked against invariants; 9 DB-free guard tests; 3 Postgres tests of the
  gate and its audit rows. By hand against Keycloak 26.3.0 and the real API: clinician 200, auditor 403, no role 403, unlisted route 403, no
  token 401; the UI shows "Your role does not allow this." for the no-role user (6 end-to-end tests passed).
- **Behaviour change:** a valid Keycloak or PASETO token with no recognised role used to be enough for `compare`; it now gets 403.
- **Not done:** the record-level `evaluate` is called by no handler; no consent store, break-the-glass grant store or masking (SE-2 to SE-4);
  no care-relationship lookup. **The permission table, label lists and purpose rules are an engineer's first draft that no clinical safety
  officer or privacy officer has reviewed.** With login off there is no authorization (development only). 401s are not audited.

### Added after the first cut: patient create, read, update, search (ID-3, in part)

- Migration `patient_versions` (append-only, triggers) and view `patient_current`; `POST/GET /api/patients`, `GET/PUT /api/patients/{id}`. Gated by role and by
  `policy::evaluate` (the engine's first caller), validated (NHS number check digit, real birth dates), every access audited without demographics.
- Tested: 7 Postgres tests (versions, stale and racing writers, immutability, search, wildcards, the 50-row cap); 4 validation tests. By hand against Keycloak 26.3.0
  and the real API: 201, 422, 200, 409, 403 for patient role, auditor and a research purpose.
- **Not done:** FHIR `Patient`; phonetic and typeahead search; no load test (the 200 ms p95 target is unmeasured, and search scans); the write and its audit row are
  separate transactions; 422 and 400 are not audited; patient and proxy roles cannot read their own record (no relationship lookup); no UI page; no duplicate check at
  registration (ID-4), so the same person can be registered twice.

### Added after the first cut: duplicate prevention at registration (ID-4, API only)

- `POST /api/patients` scores the new record against candidates (same identifier, birth date or family name) with the matcher; any that is not a `non_match` gives
  **409** with each candidate's record, score, breakdown and conflicts. `override_reason` registers anyway; the reason is kept in the version history and the audit row
  lists the candidate ids. A failed candidate lookup fails the registration rather than skipping the check.
- Tested: 3 unit tests and 1 Postgres test; by hand: first 201, repeat 409, blank override 409, real override 201, audit rows as expected.
- **Not done:** the UI comparison page; misspelt-name-and-different-birth-date duplicates are not found; concurrent registrations can both pass; no separate override permission.

### Added after the first cut: patient pages in the UI (ID-7, in part; finishes the ID-4 UI line)

- `/patients` searches (family-name prefix, birth date, NHS number; an empty search is not sent), `/patients/new` registers, `/patients/[id]` shows and edits a record with the
  version it was read at (a stale save says the record changed and offers a reload), `/patients/compare` keeps the two-patient comparison. On a 409 duplicate the new page shows each
  candidate beside what was entered, with the matcher's score, reasons and a link to the existing record, and registers anyway only with a typed reason. The edit form changes only
  the fields it shows: other names, identifiers, addresses and contact details are carried into the new version (unit-tested). The proxy now forwards `PUT`.
- Tested: 13 new vitest (63 total); 10 new stubbed Playwright tests with axe on each page state (17 total); and against a real Keycloak and API, one new end-to-end test
  (bad NHS number, register, duplicate, override, two-window stale edit, search) with the audit rows read back. 6 passed, 2 skipped there.
- Found while running it: the Podman VM's clock was 18 minutes behind the host, so Keycloak's tokens were already expired by the API's clock, and `axum-keycloak-auth` reports an
  expired token as `InvalidSignature` (it keeps only the last key's error). Fixed by setting the VM clock; noted in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Not done:** the persistent patient banner (photo, two identifiers, age, allergies status) the ID-7 acceptance asks for; the page does not send `X-Purpose-Of-Use`, so every call is
  `operations`; no pagination past 50 results; no phonetic or typeahead search; the form edits the first name, NHS number and first postcode only (a second name or address cannot be
  edited, only kept); English strings only; the Keycloak end-to-end run is not in CI.

### Added after the first cut: patient consent (SE-2, identity only)

- `consent.rs` (rules), `consents_store.rs` (append-only `consent_versions`, optimistic updates), `controllers/consents.rs`, migration `…000003`. A consent holds permit and deny provisions by
  role, purpose, resource kind, security label and period. `consent::decide` reduces a patient's current active consents to the policy engine's consent value: deny wins; a permit must
  name every label on the record; an unreadable provision denies. A refusal now stops reads of that patient's identity (403, audited with the consent ids), drops them from search and
  redacts them in the duplicate check (`{"restricted": true}`; the duplicate still blocks registration). The UI shows a restricted candidate as a message with no record.
- Tested: 19 unit tests, each core rule broken in turn to see a test fail; 5 Postgres tests; by hand against Keycloak and the API as clinician, receptionist and clinical admin (read 403 then
  200 after withdrawal, search 0 vs 1, `restricted` candidate, route-gate refusals, 422 for unknown values, 404, stale 409, audit rows read back); 1 new UI test.
- Found while running it: the Podman VM clock was behind again (see `AGENTS.md`).
- **Not done:** acceptance not met (no export to honour consent, no clinical record to hide); the opt-out changes nothing today because no role may use the `research` purpose; patient and proxy
  cannot manage consent; no consent UI or FHIR `Consent`; no handler-level automated test of the denial paths; no emergency override (a privacy-officer decision); consent lookups cost one query
  per read or search, unmeasured.

### Added after the first cut: audit-chain verify endpoint (AU-1 acceptance)

- `GET /api/audit/verify`, auditor only: recomputes the chain and answers `{intact, rows, keyed, assurance}` (200) or the first broken row (**409**). Each check writes its own audit row
  (outcome and counts, never row contents) and the endpoint fixes the purpose of use at `audit`. `audit::verify` now reads in batches of 1000 by keyset, so memory no longer grows with the table.
- Tested: 2 new Postgres tests (batch sizes 1 to 1000 agree; a break either side of a batch boundary is found; the endpoint logic reports intact then 409 and writes two rows);
  by hand against Keycloak and the API: no token 401, clinician 403 (audited), auditor 200, then 409 naming row 1 after I turned the triggers off and edited it.
- **Not done:** removal of the newest rows is not detected (no external anchor); an unkeyed chain (no `EPR_INTEGRITY_MAC_KEY`) can be recomputed by anyone who can write to the database
  (the response says so); no handler-level automated test (the endpoint logic is tested, the HTTP wiring only by hand); no search API over the log (AU-2); no UI; verifying a very long chain is a
  full scan with no rate limit.

### Added after the first cut: care-relationship lookup (SE-1 gap)

- `relationships.rs`, `controllers/relationships.rs`, migration `…000004`, policy resource `CareRelationship` (clinical-admin only; the matrix is now 10 × 10 × 6 × 8 × 5 × 3 × 7 × 2 = 1,008,000 requests).
  `authorize` looks up the caller's relationship to the patient on every patient, consent and relationship route, so the `patient` and `proxy` roles are no longer refused by construction.
- Tested: 3 unit and 3 Postgres tests; by hand against Keycloak and the API with a patient-role user: refused before a link (403), self-grant refused by the route gate, linked by an administrator
  (201), reads own record with `patient-access` (200) but not with the default purpose, not another patient's, a second patient user not A's, manages own consent and is not stopped by their own
  deny, refused again once the relationship is ended; a change of subject is 400.
- **Not done:** relationships are only what an administrator types: nothing derives care team or encounter from clinical activity, there is no expiry job (periods are checked at read time), no
  UI, and the service cannot check that the `sub` is the patient. The UI proxy does not send `X-Purpose-Of-Use`, so a patient cannot read through the UI yet. One extra query per request, unmeasured.
  Care-team access still has nothing to gate (no clinical content); break-the-glass (SE-3) is still not built.

### Added after the first cut: purpose of use in the UI and a patient "my record" page

- `GET /api/me/patients` (service) lists the records linked to the caller by a `self` or `proxy` relationship, each through the full decision, purpose fixed at `patient-access`. The UI proxy forwards
  `X-Purpose-Of-Use` when it is a known code and drops anything else; `/my-record` shows the records read-only and says plainly when nothing is linked.
- Tested: 1 Postgres test (`own_patients`), 3 vitest, 2 stubbed Playwright tests with axe, and one real Keycloak end-to-end test: an administrator links a patient-role user, who signs in through the UI, sees
  only that record, is refused another (403), and sees nothing once the link is ended. 7 passed, 2 skipped there.
- **Not done:** staff pages still send no purpose (so `operations`); no purpose picker; the UI proxy\'s forwarding is unit-tested and exercised by the end-to-end run but has no test with a stub upstream;
  patients cannot edit, print or download anything, or see who accessed their record (SE-6); no relationship or consent UI for administrators; the linking is still an API call.

### Added after the first cut: staff declare treatment from the UI

- A header picker (Operations or Treatment) sets the `X-Purpose-Of-Use` sent on staff calls; it is kept per tab and `/my-record` is unaffected. Real run: a clinician chose Treatment, searched, and the audit
  trail holds a row with purpose `treatment`.
- Tested: 3 vitest (70 in all), 1 stubbed Playwright test (21 in all) and 1 real Keycloak test (7 passed, 3 skipped there).
- **Not done:** the choice is a declaration, not a check: nothing confirms the clinician is treating this patient (that needs the relationship gate on clinical content, which has no content yet); no
  `emergency` option; the default is still Operations; a role that may not use a purpose just gets 403 with no hint which purpose would work.

### Added after the first cut: the `hl7`, `er7`, `fhir` and `snomed` crates, and a comparison with `openehr`

- Service dependencies: `hl7` 0.2.3, `er7` 0.2.2, `fhir` 4.2.4 (R4 only), `snomed` 0.56.1 (all this project\'s author\'s crates; MSRV 1.96, no build scripts; +19 crates in the lock file; `cargo deny` clean).
  Each is used, in `src/interop` (library only, no endpoint): FHIR R4 `Patient` both ways with dropped elements named, HL7 v2 ADT to an identity record with `AA`/`AE`/`AR` acknowledgements, and a
  SNOMED CT identifier check. 19 unit tests.
- `spec/interoperability/openehr-comparison.md`: the `openehr` 0.10 crate against this project, from reading its source and running two of its examples. Verdict: not a dependency now (a second clinical
  model next to FHIR, MSRV 1.97 against our documented 1.96, nothing yet to hold); six ideas worth taking, chiefly an externally published audit-head checkpoint, reporting an unheld key as a key problem
  rather than tampering, and a contribution that makes a write and its audit row one transaction. It also records that its example 04 labels an oldest-first list "most recent first".
- **Not done:** no `/fhir/R4/Patient` endpoint, no MLLP listener, no HL7 message stored or matched (ID-3 and OR-3 stay open); the FHIR mapping covers the thin identity record only; HL7 mapping reads
  `PID` and `MSH` only (no `PV1`, no merge `MRG`, so A40 is unsupported); `fhir` R4 lengthens a clean build (the first build after adding it took about two minutes here, not separately measured); none of the six ideas from the
  comparison is built; the comparison has not tested openEHR conformance or mapped our record into openEHR.

### Changed after the first cut

- The matcher is published as `electronic-patient-record-matcher` 0.1.0 on crates.io; the service depends on it from
  the registry (no path dependency), so its container build no longer copies the matcher.
- Docker replaced by Podman everywhere: `Containerfile` and `.containerignore` instead of `Dockerfile` and
  `.dockerignore`; `podman build` / `podman compose` in CI and release. Image names still use the `docker.io/…`
  registry, which is only a registry name.

### Not done or not verified

- No clinical record, no FHIR endpoints, no patient storage, no patient CRUD, no merge.
- Audit: no verify endpoint, denied requests are not audited, no other route is audited (none reads stored data), and
  an existing unkeyed chain cannot adopt a key later. Without `EPR_INTEGRITY_MAC_KEY` the chain is unkeyed SHA-256
  (warned at startup), so someone who can write SQL can recompute it.
- Authorization is a role gate per route only; consent, break-the-glass and masking are not built (SE-2 to SE-4). The UI signs in through
  Keycloak, but with sign-in off (no `EPR_OIDC_ISSUER`) its proxy sends no token and only works against an API with login off.
- The matcher has 13 hand-written tests, not the 200-pair labelled corpus the acceptance criterion in ID-1 asks
  for, and no fuzz target. Its thresholds are unvalidated guesses.
- Only English strings exist; the other nine locales fall back to English. No Lily widgets are used yet.
- Run by hand on 2026-10-20: both images built; the compose stack reached healthy; with no keys the API container
  exits 1 ("refusing to start"); with a key set an unauthenticated call gets 401; the UI image serves, redirects to
  `/en-001`, and its proxy 404s outside `/api`.
- **Not run:** the GitHub Actions workflows (`ci.yml`, `release.yml`) have never executed (the Podman steps in them, including `podman-compose` and the multi-arch `podman manifest` push, are untested; `podman compose` locally delegates to a Homebrew `docker-compose` client talking to Podman), so any error in them is
  unknown; there is no zap job and no chaos workflow; the release image and SBOM steps are untested.
- No hazard log, no clinical safety officer, no governance pack (AS-1 to AS-3).
