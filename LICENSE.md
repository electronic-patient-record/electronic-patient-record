## Why a choice, and why a directory

The permissive licences (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause) suit organizations that
embed or adapt the code in their own products; Apache-2.0 adds an explicit
patent grant. The GNU licences suit those who want copyleft. Offering all five
lets each user take the one that fits their own constraints. Custom terms are
for cases none of them fits.

All licence texts live in the [`LICENSE/`](LICENSE) directory, one file per
licence in the expression, and nowhere else in the repository. This file is the
only licence-related file outside it. Forge licence detection usually looks for
a root `LICENSE` file, so it may not recognize this layout; this file and the
[README](README.md#licence) carry the statement instead.

`tests/licence_files.rs` in the API crate keeps the manifests, the expression,
`LICENSE/` and this file consistent.
